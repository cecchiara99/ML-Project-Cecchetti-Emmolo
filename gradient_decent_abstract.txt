This project is about the Python implementation from scratch of an Multi Layer Perceptron simulator, where the
training part consist in a Minibatch Stochastic Gradient Descent with Backpropagation. We perform a model selection
exploiting Grid Search and 5-Fold Cross Validation to test the network with the MONK problem and to find the best
model for the CUP competition.
