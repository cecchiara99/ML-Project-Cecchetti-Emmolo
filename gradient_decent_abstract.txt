This project is about the implementation from scratch of a Multi Layer Perceptron simulator in Python.
The training phase consists in a Minibatch Stochastic Gradient Descent with Backpropagation. We perform a
model selection exploiting Grid Search and a 5-Fold Cross Validation to test the network on the MONK problem
and to find the best model for the CUP competition. The final goal was obtain the output results on a Blind Test.
