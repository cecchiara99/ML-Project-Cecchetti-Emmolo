## Description

This project is about the Python implementation from scratch of an Multi Layer Perceptron simulator, where the
training part consist in a Minibatch Stochastic Gradient Descent with Backpropagation.
We perform a model selection exploiting Grid Search and 5-Fold Cross Validation to test the network with the MONK problem and to find the best model for the CUP competition.
The final goal was to find the
